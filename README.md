# JSONL - Generator

The purpose of this JSONL - Generator is to generate two output files: `train_file.jsonl` and `valid_file.jsonl`.
The output files are going to be used for fine tunning an local LLM on MacOS using the Appleâ€™s MLX framework.

The Input for the generator should be an JSON file called `instructions.json` which will contain questions generated via Llama3-8b LLM.
